# team-atomic-thunder-project
## COS 420 project for Team A AKA Team Atomic Thunder

### Align ~ 'Sync your tasks with your goals'

### Description: 
As a team, we hope to offer a way to make tracking easier and more accessible for students. Prior solutions to tracking assignments are varied, from physical paper planners, to excel spreadsheets, to the notes app in our phones which are very helpful but still lack a wide range of tools. To add on, manually transferring these dates from multiple PDF syllabi into personal calendars is time-consuming and error-prone, leading to missed deadlines and increased academic stress. However, all of these solutions require the commitment constantly updating and maintaining them as new assignments get released, due dates change, and courses progress.
