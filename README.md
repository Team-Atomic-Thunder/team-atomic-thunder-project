# Team Atomic Thunder Project
## COS 420 Project - Align: Sync your tasks with your goals

### Description
As a team, we hope to offer a way to make tracking easier and more accessible for students. Prior solutions to tracking assignments are varied, from physical paper planners, to excel spreadsheets, to the notes app in our phones which are very helpful but still lack a wide range of tools. To add on, manually transferring these dates from multiple PDF syllabi into personal calendars is time-consuming and error-prone, leading to missed deadlines and increased academic stress. However, all of these solutions require the commitment constantly updating and maintaining them as new assignments get released, due dates change, and courses progress.

### Team
- Project Manager - Zo Carroll (zo.carroll@maine.edu)
- Designer - Kursten Massey (kursten.massey@maine.edu)
- Developers - Meghann Manson (meghann.manson@maine.edu), Liv Anderson (liv.anderson@maine.edu), & Siaka Diarra (siaka.diarra@maine.edu)

### Commands to Run the Project

All commands should be run from the root directory of the project (team-atomic-thunder-project)

1. Make sure to be in "team atomic thunder project" directory, no need to be in src to run code.

Install all dependencies (run this first):
```bash
npm run install:all
```

2. Start both frontend and backend:
```bash
npm start
```

This will run:
- Frontend on http://localhost:3003
- Backend on http://localhost:3002
